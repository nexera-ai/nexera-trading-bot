              Windows Installation Guide
======================================================

Thank you for choosing neXera Trading Platform!

====================
IMPORTANT NOTE
====================
If you're experiencing issues with the executable file, we've provided 
multiple launch options to ensure compatibility with all Windows systems.

====================
OPTION 1: DIRECT RUN (RECOMMENDED)
====================
The most reliable way to run neXera is to use the Direct_Run.bat file.
This launches the platform directly without creating an executable,
avoiding Windows security restrictions and compatibility issues.

Steps:
1. Install Python 3.10 or higher from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Double-click on "Direct_Run.bat"
3. The script will install dependencies and launch the platform
4. Access the platform at: http://localhost:5000

====================
OPTION 2: QUICK START
====================
If you want to create an executable, use the Quick_Start.bat file.
This will attempt to create and run a Windows executable file.

Steps:
1. Install Python 3.10 or higher from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Double-click on "Quick_Start.bat"
3. The script will attempt to create an executable and launch it
4. If successful, the platform will be accessible at: http://localhost:5000

====================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================
If you encounter any issues:

"Windows cannot find neXera_Trading_Bot.exe":
- Use Option 1 (Direct_Run.bat) instead

"This app can't run on your PC":
- Use Option 1 (Direct_Run.bat) instead
- Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed

"Missing DLL" or other dependency errors:
- Use Option 1 (Direct_Run.bat) instead
- Make sure you have Python and all required packages installed

====================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
====================
- Windows 10 or higher
- Python 3.10 or higher (with "Add to PATH" selected during installation)
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 1GB free disk space

====================
OPERATING MODES
====================
The platform operates in "Paper Trading" mode by default, which simulates
trading without using real funds. This is perfect for testing strategies.

To use real trading, you will need to configure exchange API keys with 
trading permissions (but not withdrawal permissions for security).
